            <h3 class="text">I grew up on a homestead in a small town but despite the small town and its small ideas, I have always had the desire to be larger than life.
                the harsh environment of living on a homestead gave a great work ethic and a can do attitude. Despite the stereotype of farmers I have always loved technology
                and that was the driving force behind my desire to learn coding. I am currently taking a coding bootcamp course to further my career in technology and coding.

                    <li>
                         I started my working life as a farm hand for neighboring homesteads around my family's.

                         My next job was at a small coffee shop where I prepaired drinks, cleaned the shop, and handled transactions along with many other things.

                    <li>
                         I then began my job as a delivery driver for my local Papa John's, and after 3 months of hard work and attention to
                        detail, I was promoted to instore employee. That job entailed making pizzas, cleaning the shop, handling cash transactions and ensuring customer satisfaction to the best of my ability. Next, after about 1.5 months, I was promoted to Manager.
                        In this postion I was in charge of making the dough needed for the day at opening and tasking other employees with jobs throughout the day. I was also tasked with dispatching delivery drivers and maintaining a clean resturant environment, as well as
                        handling customer complaints and reaching a solution to any grievences. The list of responsibilities is far too long to put into a small summary.
