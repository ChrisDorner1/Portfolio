                <h3>I grew up in a rural town on a homestead and have always loved technology. That love for tech lead me to pursue
                    small electronics repair at an early age. That love for repair lead me to pursue a career first in IT and was furthered by the U of A coding bootcamp.
                    Growing up on a homestead off grid gave me a strong work ethic early on and the "can do" attitude as well as making me not afraid to get my hands dirty.
                    I bring a good vibe to the table and always have a tasteful and good joke or pun to share with coworkers and higher ups. However everyone has their downfalls
                    I am no exception to this, one of my biggest weaknesses is I can't stand not understanding everything and knowing how to do everything that needs to be done.
